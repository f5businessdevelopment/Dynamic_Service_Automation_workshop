Welcome to F5 and HashiCorp automation workshop. 
This training will take you through the basic knowledge and exercises to gain understanding on how F5 BIG-IP can leverage HashiCorp Terraform and HashiCorp Consul to facilitate automated application network delivery.

This workshop will cover:

-  Exploring some automation basics.
-  Introduce concepts of Network Infrastructure Automation (NIA)
-  F5 Automation Toolchain (AS3) and F5 Application Services Templates (FAST).
-  Using COnsul and Terraform to congfigure dynamic service automation on BIG-IP

**Pre-requisites**

To get the most out of this training, the student should already have some basic knowledge about the use of Terraform, Consul and BIG-IP.

**Lab Environment**

We will use Unified Demo Framework (UDF) to run through the exercises in this workshop. The content is a multi-purpose toolkit for demonstrating BIG-IP automation capabilities using Terraform and Consul in various forms -- instructor led, hands-on or self paced.

The following topics will be covered

## Section 0 - Fundementals (instructor led presentation)
